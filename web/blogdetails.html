                <p>The “Profile of Mona Lisa” tour marked a transformative chapter in my journey, blending
                    personal
                    growth
                    with creative exploration. From debuting on stage with a guitar to embracing new challenges
                    like
                    dance,
                    every moment was a step toward self-discovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Collaborations with talented artists and heartfelt connections with the audience made this
                    experience
                    unforgettable. Though this chapter has come to an end, the memories and lessons will inspire
                    future
                    endeavors. Thank you for being part of this meaningful journey—I look forward to sharing
                    even
                    more
                    with
                    you in the future.

                    The “Profile of Mona Lisa” tour concluded with heartfelt performances, including my first guitar
                    debut. Though health issues delayed the Nagoya show, your patience and support filled me with
                    joy
                    and relief.

                    Covering Kessoku Band's “That Band” during the encore revived my high school guitar dreams.
                    While
                    imperfect, this performance brought deep personal fulfillment and reconnected me with my
                    creative roots.
