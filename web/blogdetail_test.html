                <h6>The “Profile of Mona Lisa” tour marked a transformative chapter in my journey, blending personal
                    growth
                    with
                    creative exploration. From debuting on stage with a guitar to embracing new challenges like dance,
                    every
                    moment was a step toward self-discovery.</h6>

                <h6>Collaborations with talented artists and heartfelt connections with the audience made this
                    experience
                    unforgettable. Though this chapter has come to an end, the memories and lessons will inspire future
                    endeavors. Thank you for being part of this meaningful journey—I look forward to sharing even more
                    with
                    you
                    in the future.</h6>

                Covering Kessoku Band's “That Band” during the encore revived my high school guitar dreams. While
                imperfect, this performance brought deep personal fulfillment and reconnected me with my creative
                roots.
